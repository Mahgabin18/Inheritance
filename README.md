# Inheritance of ANIMALS
This project is from my CSCI235 class and it introduces inheritance, as it inherits from the base classes into derived classes 

In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation.

Also defined as deriving new classes from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes
